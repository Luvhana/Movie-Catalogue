            Naina Talwar, an introverted medical student, reconnects with her adventurous former classmates, Aditi Mehra, Kabir "Bunny" Thapar, and Avinash "Avi" Shiv, on a hiking trip to the Himalayas. Naina falls for Bunny, whose dream is to travel the world, but remains silent about her feelings when he leaves for Northwestern University.

            Eight years later, Naina is a doctor, and Bunny is a successful travel show host. They reunite at Aditi's wedding, where old feelings resurface. Bunny and Naina confess their love but part ways due to their career ambitions. On the night of the wedding, Bunny reconsiders his priorities and returns to Naina, proposing they build a life together while continuing their adventures. Naina agrees, and they embrace, beginning a new chapter together.
